4. The tiny arrays start out at similar speeds, but as size increases, the difference
becomes even more noticeable, with the XL array taking only 5 milliseconds with insert
but a whole 1 second with append. This difference will become extremely important if you
have a large project.

5. Unshift is slower than push because it has to shift all of the elements over in order
to add a new number to the beginning of the array, while push only has to add one element
to the end of the array.
